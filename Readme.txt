This is the original code of 15-112 TP of Sheng Xu.

You can see the server and database files here, but there is another file solely for distribution (made by py2app, link: https://drive.google.com/file/d/0B3EEZnjSqgINY2NHSmlRMlIxTG8/view?usp=sharing) that does not include the server and the database files. 

In order to run the server on your computer, please put your andrew id in myandrewid.txt and your andrew password in my password.txt, and then run GameServer.

If that does not work, please go to the GameServer class and comment out lines 293-310, and change self.HOST at line 290 to ‘’ (localhost)

Then you can run the GamePlayer class (or you can create a lot of identical copies of Gameplayer class (like i have did for you in Gameplayer1) so you can simulate online mode on your own computer. 

Even without opening the server, though, you can still run the GamePlayer class and play single computer mode (1 on 1).
