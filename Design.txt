Design Document

This is a remake of the favorite game of my childhood, Bomb man. I tried to
make it as accurate as possible to the original game. Many small details of 
this game, while not apparent at first, are very hard to make (such as layering
images, the tunnel in treasurehunt and the door in hero mode which have weird 
attributes, how explosions of bubbles work(which group with which), how can
players not get items that they have put down, multithreading not destroying the
game, how to make the game smooth in multiplayer by using non-blocking sockets,
how to detect server disconnection or client disconnection by check-alive messages,
how to set up static ip, how to do different modes, how to single out all data 
to a single allgamedata file, how to put everything into a single app file through
py2app, and so on). I really enjoyed doing this project.

Thanks for help from my mentor Lukas. And 4 of my friends (Leo, Alex, Qiuyu, 
and Muyu) who helped in my video. The images of the characters come from 
http://www.2gei.com/view/9714.html. The pygamegame class is adapted from
my mentor Lukas' version. The other images and some audios are adapted from various 
websites from google and baidu and trimmed and editted through gimp, paintbrush 
and audacity. Some audios feature sounds from some of my other friends (Annie,
Ziang, Gao). And thanks for mouse@cmu.edu for teaching my os programming in python.
